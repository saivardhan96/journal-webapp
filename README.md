This is a web application developed using Spring Boot. As part of my learning process, I have developed this application.


# How this works ?
* Contains two roles, Admin and User
* User can post or delete journals and see which journals he has posted.
* users can also edit their passwords or reset if they've forgot.
* Admin can check who are the existing users. Number of posts they've made and all.
* I've also added public endpoints which lets new users to signup and start posting the journals.
* Once a user signs up, he receives a welcome email which will have his username and password.

## Concepts learnt
* Dependency Injection
* Spring Security
* Spring Data JPA with MongoDB
* Security using JWT
* Email scheduling
* Logging using slf4j

There are lot of things which are to be worked with. I'm also working on my major project paralelly which can cause delay and unusual updates.
I'll be pushing the changes to the repo once I have implemented any new topics or concepts and also update the "Concepts learnt" column.

## To be implemented:
* Front end using react
